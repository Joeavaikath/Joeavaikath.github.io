# GitHub User Page Guide
## Basic Info
### What is this?

GitHub allows users to create user pages, wherein the page would be displayed through the link https://???.github.io. Replace ??? with your GitHub username.
Also, I'm learning Markdown syntax while I'm at it. Fun!

Main aims of this project:
[]HTML up my user page
[]Document said changes
[]Learn Markdown syntax
[x]Check something off to make it seem cool

### Why though?

As of starting this project my HTML/CSS/JS knowledge is *dismal*. I want to change that.
Bonus, I get to make a neat user page that acts as my CV for easy sharing. Can't just have a offline PDF file for that in 2019 now can we.

## Walkthrough

Alright, let me list out stuff I want on my user page:

- Big banner with my name, subscripted links to my profiles on:
 - LinkedIn
 - GitHub
- My internships
- Acadamic Info
- Language/Tool knowledge levels
- Projects
- Awards/Events Participated in
- Optionally:
 -A summary section? This should immediately follow my banner

 Content wise that would do. Heck, I could easily type that info out. Whats challenging is designing a good HTML template.

 Design wise I could see:
 - Parallax scrolling
 - ??
